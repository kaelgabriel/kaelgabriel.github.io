  abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), or drones, have
recently been used in several civil application domains from
organ delivery to remote locations to wireless network coverage.
These platforms, however, are naturally unstable systems for
which many different control approaches have been proposed.
Generally based on classic and modern control, these algorithms
require knowledge of the robot’s dynamics. However, recently,
model-free reinforcement learning has been successfully used for
controlling drones without any prior knowledge of the robot
model. In this work, we present a framework to train the
Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm to low-level control of a
quadrotor in a go-to-target task. All experiments were conducted
under simulation. With the experiments, we show that SAC
can not only learn a robust policy, but it can also cope with
unseen scenarios.},

  title={Reinforcement and Imitation Learning Applied to Autonomous Aerial Robot Control},
  author={Barros, Gabriel Moraes},

  abstract={ In robotics, the ultimate goal of reinforcement learning is to endow robots with the ability to learn, improve, adapt, and reproduce tasks with dynamically changing constraints based on exploration and autonomous learning. Reinforcement Learning (RL) aims at addressing this problem by enabling a robot to learn behaviors through trial-and-error. With RL, a Neural Network can be trained as a function approximator to directly map states to actuator commands making any predefined control structure not-needed for training. However, the knowledge required to converge these methods are usually built from scratch, learning may take a long time, not to mention that RL algorithms need a stated reward function and sometimes it is not trivial to define one. Often it is easier for a teacher, human or intelligent agent, do demonstrate the desired behavior or how to accomplish a given task. Humans and other animals have a natural ability to learn skills from observation, often from merely seeing the effects of these skills: without direct knowledge of the underlying actions being taken. The same principle exists in Imitation Learning, a practical approach for autonomous systems to acquire control policies when an explicit reward function is unavailable, using supervision provided as demonstrations from an expert, typically a human operator. In this scenario, the primary objective of this work is to design an agent that can successfully imitate a prior acquired control policy using Imitation Learning. The chosen algorithm is GAIL since we consider that it is the proper algorithm to tackle this problem by utilizing expert (state, action) trajectories. As reference expert trajectories, we implement state-of-the-art on and off-policy methods PPO and SAC. Results show that the learned policies for all three methods can solve the task of low-level control of a quadrotor and that all can account for generalization on the original tasks},

  title={A Customer Journey Mapping Approach to Improve CPFL Energia Fraud Detection Predictive Models},
  author={Gusmao, Lídia and Anarelli, Tales and Helito, Hugo and Barros, Gabriel and Conceição, Júlia},
  year={2020},
  publisher={IEEE},
  abstract={Non-Technical Losses have a profound economical
impact in distribution utilities; hence, reducing them and pursu-
ing revenue recovery makes up for an essential means to secure
utilities’ financial health. In that regard, this paper proposes a
compound method that combines a Logistic Regression predictive
algorithm with the concept of Customer Journeys, in order to
enhance the accuracy of the fraud detection method traditionally
applied in CPFL Energia (a major Brazilian utility). Every inter-
action of each CPFL’s customer is taken in consideration to track
fraudulent customers record and identify suspicious patterns,
with the purpose of adding new data to the present model and
better refining its outcome, thus reducing false-positives and
achieving both greater accuracy and recovered revenue amounts,
besides better operational efficiency. The proposed methodology
was field tested, resulting in a 2.2 times greater fraud inspection
success rate, and the model was effectively implemented on the
internal processes of the company’s department responsible for
fraud detection and revenue recovery.},

  publisher={Pergamon},
  journal={International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer},
  abstract={The present numerical study performs a geometrical evaluation of a triangular arrangement of circular
cylinders subjected to transient, two-dimensional, incompressible, laminar, and aiding mixed convective
flows by means of Constructal Design. It is investigated a multiobjective problem: maximize Nusselt
number (NuD) and minimize drag coefficient (CD). In order to investigate the influence of buoyancy forces
over design of the arrangement of cylinders five different Grashof numbers (GrD) are studied leading to
different Richardson numbers: Ri = GrD/ReD2 = 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 5.0 and 10.0. For all simulations, constant
Reynolds and Prandtl numbers (ReD = 100 and Pr = 0.71) are considered. For geometric evaluation, the
problem is subjected to two constraints (cross-sectional area of three cylinders and an occupation area
for the arrangement) and two degrees of freedom (the ratio between the longitudinal pitch and cylinder
diameter (SL/D) and ratio between the transversal pitch and cylinder diameter (ST/D)). In numerical sim-
ulations, the conservation equations of mass, momentum and energy are solved using Finite Volume
Method (FVM). Results showed that buoyancy forces in mixed convective flows have strong influence
over design of the studied cylinders arrangement. For instance, the effects of ST/D and SL/D over CD and
Nu D changed significantly for different Ri evaluated. Concerning the multiobjective evaluation, for
Ri = 0.1 (forced convective flows) intermediate ratios of ST/D and SL/D, different from that achieved for
the isolated purposes, conducted to the best multiobjetive performance, while for Ri = 10.0 (natural con-
vective flows) the best shape is the same reached for the thermal objective, i.e., the multiobjective anal-
ysis for natural convective flow was guided by thermal purpose.},

  abstract={ The present study consists on the numerical evaluation of a triangular arrangement of circular cylinders
submitted to transient, two-dimensional, incompressible, laminar and mixed convective flows. The geometrical
evaluation is performed by means of Constructal Design. For all simulations it is considered Reynolds and Prandtl
numbers of ReD = 100 and Pr = 0.71. Moreover, three different values of Richardson number are investigated: Ri =
0.1 (which represents flows dominated by forced convective), 1.0 (which represents an equilibrium between forced and
natural driven forces) and 10.0 (which represents flows with dominance of natural convective). The conservation
equations of mass, momentum and energy are solved with the use of Finite Volume Method (FVM). The buoyancy
forces are tackled with the Boussinesq approximation. The area occupied by the triangular arrangement of cylinders is
a geometric constraint of the problem and the cylinders have the same diameter. The main purpose is to evaluate the
effect of Richardson number over the drag coefficient (CD ) and Nusselt number (NuD) between the cylinders and the
surrounding flow, as well as, over the optimal ratio ST/D (ratio between transversal pitch and the cylinder) for two
different values of the ratio SL/D = 1.5 and 2.5 (ratio between longitudinal pitch and the cylinders diameter). Results
showed that the effect of ST/D over drag coefficient and Nusselt number is strongly affected by the magnitude of
Richardson number. Concerning the Nusselt number, for Ri = 0.1 the optimal geometry which maximizes the NuD is
reached for the highest magnitude of ST/D, while for Ri = 10.0 an intermediate optimal ratio of ST/D maximizes the
NuD. The Richardson magnitudes also have large influence over the fluid dynamic and thermal behavior of fluid flow
for all evaluated geometries. An increase in the ratio SL/D improved the heat exchange of the flow, but decreased the
fluid dynamic performance.},
