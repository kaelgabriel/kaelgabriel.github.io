Hi, I am Gabriel! I am an Engineer/Researcher/Data Scientist interested in engineering, data science, math, deep reinforcement learning, and Brazil.

My research interests lie in machine learning for robotic control to enable generalizable and adaptable behaviors for autonomous agents operating in the real-world. 

I've worked with Prof. Esther Colombini Laboratory of Robotics and Cognitive Systems ) at IC/Unicamp, working on model-free reinforcement learning and imitation learning methods with applications in mobile robotics control. In another life, I also worked with Prof. Elizaldo dos Santos at the Numerical Simulation Lab in the Federal University of Rio Grande, studying the influence of mixed convection in a cross-flow over circular cylinders, trying to increase the efficiency of thermal systems.
